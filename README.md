### Links

- Live Site URL: [Netlify](https://nostalgic-kepler-8d16c4.netlify.app)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Overall, I learned to use flexbox a little better, though I can get better with more practice.

I also learned its easier to start with mobile first layouts and then use media queries to lay out desktop designs.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Image overlays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXQ9l0ScDEA&t=315s) - This helped me with adding a purple overlay for the image. It's a good video to show how overlays can make a site look much better.
